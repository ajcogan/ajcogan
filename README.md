# 👋 Hi, I'm Ashley

I'm a control systems engineer with a background in utility SCADA, telemetry, and industrial automation.

I specialize in:
- 🔌 **Protocol simulation & tooling** – Modbus, DNP3, H5000
- 🛰️ **SCADA telemetry systems** – integration, testing, and diagnostics
- 🦀 **Rust** + 🐍 **Python** – building fast, reliable tools for engineers
- 🧠 **Simplifying legacy infrastructure** for critical industries

---

## 🚧 Current Projects

🛠️ **Rust-Based Modbus Simulator**  
A lightweight, high-performance simulator to support testing and training for SCADA systems.

🔍 **Protocol Analysis Tools**  
Developing tooling for decoding and inspecting SCADA protocol traffic (Wireshark-style).

---

## 💡 What I'm Interested In

- Building **real-time, testable simulation environments** for legacy protocols  
- Helping engineers debug and test SCADA systems faster  
- Contributing to **open-source tooling** for industrial control

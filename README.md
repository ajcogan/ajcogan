# 👋 Hi, I'm Ashley

I'm a control systems engineer with a background in utility SCADA, telemetry, and industrial automation.

I specialize in:
- 🔌 **Protocol simulation & tooling** – Modbus, DNP3, H5000
- 🛰️ **SCADA telemetry systems** – integration, testing, and diagnostics
- 🦀 **Rust** + 🐍 **Python** – building fast, reliable tools for engineers
- 🧠 **Simplifying legacy infrastructure** for critical industries

---

## 🚧 Current Projects

🛠️ **Rust-Based Modbus Simulator**  
A lightweight, high-performance simulator to support testing and training for SCADA systems.

🔍 **Protocol Analysis Tools**  
Developing tooling for decoding and inspecting SCADA protocol traffic (Wireshark-style).

---

## 💡 What I'm Interested In

- Building **real-time, testable simulation environments** for legacy protocols  
- Helping engineers debug and test SCADA systems faster  
- Contributing to **open-source tooling** for industrial control

## 🧰 Selected Repositories

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
|🦀 [modsim-rs](https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/modsim-rs) (WIP)| Rust-based Modbus simulator for SCADA testing |
| 🧪 dnp3-rs (Planned)| Stream-based frame parser for DNP3 protocol |
| 🛰️ h5000-inspector (Planned)| Toolkit for visualizing H5000 traffic |

*→ More projects coming soon as I clean up and publish prototypes.*

## 🧭 Background

I've managed and delivered over ~$10M in SCADA/control systems projects and developed tools for reporting, telemetry testing, and system integration. My recent focus is creating reusable tooling for engineers working in critical infrastructure.
